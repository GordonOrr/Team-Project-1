# Movie Moods

## Purpose
This website is designed for all users who want to know details about a specific movie, just like the year of creation, the ratings, a description, the writers, the actors, the genre and also a cool poster of the movie!
We also provide you some options if you do not know what to watch, we offer you a variety of genre options that you can choose and we will show you a huge poster with a specific random movie that you could love.
